question: 
  - Will robots rule the earth?

question_desc:
  - I hear some people say that if we're not careful then someday robots will rule the earth. Is this true?

answer:
   - Robots play a vital role in our existance today. Robots are designed to make life easier for humans by doing jobs that humans don't want to do, jobs that are inefficient for humans to do, or jobs that aren't safe for humans to do. Robots come in many shapes and sizes and include robots that put things together (like cars) and robots that do dangerous jobs (like bomb dispasal robots). Even robots that make life easier, like Automatic Teller Machines (ATMs) - they replace the need for a human bank teller to give us access to money in our bank account. In fact, we've even sent robots to Mars to explore the planet - a job that would be very difficult to have a human do. It is up to humans how much we allow robots to do, but it is unlikely that they will rule the Earth some day - but they may do a lot of jobs for us.
