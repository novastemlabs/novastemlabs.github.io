question: 
  - Are there really only 10 types of people in the world?

question_desc:
  - I heard someone say that there are only 10 types of people in the world - what does this mean?

answer:
   - As the joke goes - There are only 10 types of people in the world, those who understand binary and those who don't. This is funny to computer scientists because 10 is the binary equivelant to the number 2. Each digit in binary adds an increment of 1 to the number. So 000 is zero, 001 is one, 010 is two, 011 is three, and 0100 is four, and so on. What is the value of 00101010?
