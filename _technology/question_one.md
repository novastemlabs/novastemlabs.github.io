question: 
  - Do I need to know how to code?

question_desc:
  - I am interested in learning about technology but I don't know how to write computer code. Do I need to know?

answer:
   - Technology is about a lot more than computer science, although computer science powers a lot of technology. You certainly don't need to know how to code to learn about technology...and you probably already understand many computer science basics anyway. For example, you might think to yourself, "If Spongebob Square Pants is on TV right now, I'm going to sit and watch it, or else I am going to go out and play." That is an "IF-THEN-ELSE" statement which is one of the most common operations in computer science. IF (some condition is true - Spongebob Square Pants is on TV right now) THEN (some action - I am going to sit and watch it) ELSE (some other action - I'm going to go out and play). Another common operation is the FOR-EACH-NEXT statement. Imagine if you were putting dishes away. You might think "For each dish in the dishwasher, I am going to put it away." As you pick up each dish (FOR EACH) you make a decision about where to put it and then move on to the next one (NEXT). The same is true in computer science.
