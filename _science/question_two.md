question: 
  - Do I have to know a lot about science first?

answer:
   - For Scouts, no knowledge of science is necessary - just a curiosity and desire to learn. For adult leaders, familiarity with the material should be sufficient to lead Scouts through these modules. This topic relies on understanding the fundamentals of the scientific method - question, hypothesize, experiment, observer and record, analyze and share results.
