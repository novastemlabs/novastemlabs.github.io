  - L:NLY GBF OPNZOP ESTD?

question_desc:
  - Someone gave me a note that read "L:NLY GBF OPNZOP ESTD" - what does it mean?

answer:
   - It appears that someone gave you an encrypted note that you have to decrypt in order to read. Fortunately fo you this is a very common cipher (or code) used to encrypt messages dating back to ancient Rome. This is called a Caesar Cipher. In cryptography, a Caesar cipher (also known as a shift cipher), is one of the simplest and most widely known encryption techniques. It is a type of substitution cipher in which each letter in the text is replaced by a letter some fixed number of positions down the alphabet. The "L:" at the beginning is the key. If you write the alphabet on two strips of paper, then line the L on one up with the A on the other you can decipher the code."N" aligns with "C", "L" aligns with "A" and "Y" aligns with "N" spelling "CAN". What does the rest of the coded message say?
