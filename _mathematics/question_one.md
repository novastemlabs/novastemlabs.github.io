question: 
  - Why do people say 1 + 1 = 3?

question_desc:
  - I hear people say 1+1=3, but it doesn't. Why do poeple say that?

answer:
   - There are actually two answers to this question. The first answer is that people often say that when two people work on something together they can get more than the result if they each worked alone. Workign alone they would each get the result of one (thus one + one equals two), but together they would be able to do more than they could working alone, so 1+1= more than 2 (or 3). The second is actually a math joke. 1+1 (or 1 and 1) is 11 (just remove the + sign), and 11 in binary is actually 3. Each digit in binary adds an increment of 1 to the number. So 000 is zero, 001 is one, 010 is two, 011 is three, and 0100 is four, and so on.
