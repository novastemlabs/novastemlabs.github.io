question: 
  - Where should I put my fulcrum?

question_desc:
  - I am interested in how levers work and how they help lift and move things that are very heavy. I have heard of a fulcrum - where should I put it?

answer:
   - A lever is a simple machine consisting of a beam or rigid rod pivoted at a fixed hinge, or fulcrum. A fulcrum is the point on which the beam or rod rests or is supported and on which it pivots. There are three (3) simple machines (levers) that use a fulcrum. A Class 1 lever places the fulcrum in the center, with the effort and load at opposite ends, lie a teeter-totter. A Class 2 lever places the fulcrum at one end, with the effort on the opposite end and the load in the center, like a wheel-barrow. A Class 3 level places the fulcrum at one end, the load at the other end and the effort in the center, like a fishing pole (your elbow is the fulcrum, the fish is the load, and the effort is in lifting the pole).
