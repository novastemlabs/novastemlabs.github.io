question: 
  - Does E really equal mc squared?

question_desc:
  - My teacher said E=mc<sup>2</sup> (E equals mc squared). What does that maen, and is it true?

answer:
   - The first law of thermodynamics states "Nothing disappears; everything goes somewhere." Matter (another word for the stuff things are made of) cannot be destroyed, but only turned into energy. E=mc<sup>2</sup> is the equation that describes the amount of energy it turns into. In physics, mass–energy equivalence is a concept formulated by Albert Einstein that explains the relationship between mass and energy. where E is the energy of a physical system, m is the mass of the system, and c is the speed of light in a vacuum (about 3×10<sup>8</sup> m/s). In other words, energy equals mass multiplied by the speed of light squared.
