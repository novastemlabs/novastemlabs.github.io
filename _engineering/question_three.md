question: 
  - Which makes a pinewood derby car faster, aerodynamics or graphite?

question_desc:
  - I am building a Pinewood Derby Car and I don't have a lot of time to work on it - I want to make it as fast as possible in a small amount of time - should I focus on aerodynamics or just put graphite in the axle?

answer:
   - For the 2019 Pinewood Derby I assembled a Pinewood Derby Car in about 15-minutes to demonstrate to Scouts what makes a car faster - I even named it the "15-Minutes of Fame". I cut the wood block into a simple wedge shape (a single cut with the band saw), I screwed a weight to the bottom of the car, putting the majority of the weight toward the back, I polished the axle nails for a few minutes and bent them with an axle bender, then I added graphite and I was done. The 15-Minutes of Fame was the second fastest car in the Pinewood Derby Open Class, only beaten by a non-regulation car. Graphite makes a HUGE difference, and if you had to choose between graphite and aerodynamics, I would choose graphite. With that said, the 15-minutes of work I did on my car is enough to make any Pinewood Derby Car very competitive.
