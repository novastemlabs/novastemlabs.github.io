# About Nova STEM Labs
Nova STEM Labs was created by Doug Seven, a software engineer and product manager in Microsoft Artificial Intelligence & Research. The Nova STEM Labs were inspired by watching his 8-year old son and his fellow Cub Scouts get engaged and excited when participating in active-learning on STEM topics. Through experimentation, Doug would source and try new activities that taught his Scouts the fundamentals of Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math (STEM). 

Always wanting to scale what he does to as many people as possible, Doug created the Nova STEM Labs as a way to make his work available to as many others as possible and advocate for STEM in Cub Scouts. 

Doug loves collaboration - if you want to help out, drop an email to (counselro@NovaSTEMLabs.com[mailto:counselor@novastemlabs.com])
