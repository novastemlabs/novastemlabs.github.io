<!-- Start Hour of Code -->
The Hour of Code takes place each year during Computer Science Education Week, held annually in recognition of the birthday of computing pioneer Admiral Grace Murray Hopper (December 9, 1906). 

The Hour of Code started as a one-hour introduction to computer science, designed to demystify "code", to show that anybody can learn the basics, and to increase participation in the field of computer science. It has since become a worldwide effort to celebrate computer science, starting with 1-hour coding activities.

Every Cub Scout should have the opportunity to learn computer science. It helps improve problem-solving skills, logic and creativity. By starting early, Scouts will have a foundation for success in any 21st-century career path.

# Who is Grace Hopper
Grace Murray Hopper (December 9 1906 – January 1 1992) was an American computer scientist and United States Navy officer.

She was one of the first people to work with modern digital computers and the first programmers of the Harvard Mark I calculator. She developed the first compiler for a computer programming language.

She had the idea that programs could be written in a language that was close to English rather than in machine code or languages (such as assembly language) close to machine code, which is how it was normally done at that time. COBOL language was based very much on her philosophy.

# Its Just an Hour
The Hour of Code is just that...one hour exploring the world of coding. The Hour of Code is driven by a community of people and organizations that have come together to support the Hour of Code — including Microsoft, Apple, Amazon, Boys and Girls Clubs of America and the College Board.

## ASSIGNMENT
In a Den or Pack meeting conducted by a Scout (Scouts BSA) or Venturer who is working on his or her Supernova award, or by a Den Leader or qualified adult volunteer try a one-hour tutorial designed for your age group. 

Go to the [Hour of Code Activities](https://hourofcode.com/us/learn) and select the **Grades 2-5** filter. Select from any of the activities to start your Hour of Code.

## What Device Should I Use?
Hour of Code tutorials work on most devices and browsers. Windows, Mac, iPad, Android, and Kindle tablets are all supported.

## I don't know anything about coding. Can I still host an event?
Of course. Hour of Code activities are self-guided. All you have to do is try our current tutorials, pick the tutorial you want, and pick an hour — we take care of the rest. We also have options for every age and experience-level, from kindergarten and up.
