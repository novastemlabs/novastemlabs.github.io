<!-- Start Dr. Luis W. Alvarez Award -->
The Dr. Luis W. Alvarez Award Supernova award can be earned by Cub Scouts like you who want to soar in science. To earn the award you must be a Bear or Wolf Cub Scout who is active with a den. With your parent’s and unit leader’s help, you must select a council-approved mentor who is a registered Scouter. You may NOT choose your parent or your unit leader (unless the mentor is working with more than one youth).

# Get Started Now
The first activity to start your journey to earn the Dr. Luis W. Alvarez Supernova Award is to speak with your teacher(s) at school (or your parents if you are home-schooled) OR one of your Cub Scout leaders about your interest in earning the Cub Scout Supernova award. Ask them why they think math and science are important in your education.

**Discuss what you learn with your mentor.**
