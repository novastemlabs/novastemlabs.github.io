        <p>One of the best places to start on a Nova STEM journey is with the 'Science Everywhere' module. This module
            is designed to help you explore how science affects your life each day. Scouts will learn to see science as
            they look around, and they will learn the fundamentals of the scientific method. This module can be
            completed in four (4) weeks using the plan below.</p>

                    <h3>Week 1</h3>
                    <p>Send out an email or note welcoming the Scouts and their adult partner to the Science Everywhere
                        Nova module. In the note, assign the first activity - watch

                            Again - Season 1, Episode 8 - Three In One</a>. In this episode
                        Scouts get a lesson on water and its three basic forms--solid, liquid. When you do the
                        experiments later, you can relate back to how things can
                        change form (e.g. ice to water to steam) - although in the experiment in week 2 you will make a
                        chemical reaction that produces a gas.
                    </p>
                    <p>This activity will address 50% of <strong>Requirement #1</strong>.</p>

                    <h3>Week 2</h3>
                    <p>In week 2 you will host a Nova Lab (alternatively you can provide do-at-home instructions. In the
                        Nova Lab you will guide the Scouts through
                        using the scientific method to ask a question, create a hypothesis, experiment, observe and
                        record, analyze and share their learning. Each Scout will use the
                        <a href="#">Science Everywhere Nova Lab Worksheet</a> for this activity.

                    <p>In Week 3 you will complete an appropriate adventure for your Scouts rank.</p>
                    <p>For Wolf Cub Scouts the Germs Alive adventure is a fun adventure with a lot of activity and
                        chemical reactions. In this adventure Scouts
                        learn about germs and how they transfer from one person to another, the importance of washing
                        hands, how germs spread when they sneeze, and how mucus works (by making
                        slime - which is also a chemical reaction).

                    <h3>Week 4</h3>
                    <p>In week 4 you will wrap up this module with a visit to a place where science is done - a doctors
                        office or clinic. THis is a great place to learn how
                        science is used in every day things, and tie it back to the adventure for Requirement #2. After
                        the visit you can take 15 minutes to review the entire
                        module and discuss how science affests your everyday life.</p>

                    to
                    science. Then do the following:
                    <ol>
                        <li>Make a list of at least two questions or ideas from what you

                        <li>Discuss two of the questions or ideas with your counselor.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>A good show to have the Scouts watch in Week 1 is <a
                            href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/80108277" target="_blank">The Magic School Bus Rides

                        steam. This
                        is a great intro to how substances can change simply by changing something that affect them
