                        <p>STEM—Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics</p>
                        <p>STEM is part of an initiative the Boy Scouts of America has taken on to encourage the natural
                            curiosity of youth members and their sense of wonder about these fields through existing
                            programs. From science experiements to robotics, Scouts can’t help but enjoy the wide range
                            of STEM-related activities. To support this initiative, the BSA developed the STEM Nova
                            Awards program so that youth members have fun and receive recognition for their efforts. Cub
                            Scout Nova Awards may be earned by Wolves, Bears, Webelos, and Arrow Of Light Scouts.</p>

                        <p>Nova STEM Labs and Cub Scout Pack 571 are hosting a Nova STEM Day on May 5, 2019. This free
                            event is a great opportunity to introduce Scouts to STEM through fun and engaging hands on
                            activities, and for adult leaders to learn more about how to start a Nova program in their
                            unit.</p>
