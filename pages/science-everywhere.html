        <p>One of the best places to start on a Nova STEM journey is with the 'Science Everywhere' module. This module
            is designed to help you explore how science affects your life each day. Scouts will learn to see science as
            they look around, and they will learn the fundamentals of the scientific method. This module can be
            completed in four (4) weeks.</p>
