# Overview
This week you will learn about the **scientific method** and use it in an experiment. 

The following are the requirements addressed in Week 2.

2. Option A: Complete all of the following:
    * Explain the scientific method to your adult partner.
    * Use the scientific method in a simple science project. Explain the results to an adult.

For the full requirements, see *[Science Everywhere](https://www.scouting.org/stem-nova-awards/awards/cub-scout/science-everywhere/)* on Scouting.org. 

# Magic Inflating Balloon
Can you make a balloon inflate without using air? Sure you can! You just need to make carbon dioxide gas, which is easier than you think. When vinegar and baking soda touch, get ready to watch the reaction!

## The Scientific Method
Before you get to the experiment it is important to know about the *scientific method*. 

The scientific method is a series of steps used by scientists to determine whether a something they think (knwon as a "hypothesis") is valid or not. It can also be used to solve everyday problems in any topic or area.

There are 6-steps in the scientific method.

1. **Ask a question** - Ask yourself "what do I want to learn more about?", or "I wonder what would happen if...?"
2. **Hypothesize** - Do some research to make an educated guess (or hypothesis) about what you think the answer to your question is.
3. **Experiment** - Test your hypothesis by doing an experiment. 
4. **Observe & record** - During your experiment, make careful observations and write down what happens.
5. **Analyze** - Use the information you collected to draw conclusions about your experiment. Was your hypothesis correct?
6. **Share results** - Explain your results by presenting your experiment, observations, and conclusions.
