# Overview
This week you will learn about the **scientific method** and use it in an experiment. 

The following are the requirements addressed in Week 2.

2. Option A: Complete all of the following:
    * Explain the scientific method to your adult partner.
    * Use the scientific method in a simple science project. Explain the results to an adult.

For the full requirements, see *[Science Everywhere](https://www.scouting.org/stem-nova-awards/awards/cub-scout/science-everywhere/)* on Scouting.org. 

# Magic Inflating Balloon
Can you make a balloon inflate without using air? Sure you can! You just need to make carbon dioxide gas, which is easier than you think. When vinegar and baking soda touch, get ready to watch the reaction!

## The Scientific Method
Before you get to the experiment it is important to know about the *scientific method*. 

The scientific method is a series of steps used by scientists to determine whether a something they think (knwon as a "hypothesis") is valid or not. It can also be used to solve everyday problems in any topic or area.

There are 6-steps in the scientific method.

1. **Ask a question** - Ask yourself "what do I want to learn more about?", or "I wonder what would happen if...?"
2. **Hypothesize** - Do some research to make an educated guess (or hypothesis) about what you think the answer to your question is.
3. **Experiment** - Test your hypothesis by doing an experiment. 
4. **Observe & record** - During your experiment, make careful observations and write down what happens.
5. **Analyze** - Use the information you collected to draw conclusions about your experiment. Was your hypothesis correct?
6. **Share results** - Explain your results by presenting your experiment, observations, and conclusions. 


## Let's Make Science
Mixing vinegar and baking soda initiates a chemical reaction that produces carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) and water (H<sub>2</sub>O). The chemical names of the two ingredients are *acetic acid*, which is vinegar, and *sodium bicarbonate*, which is baking soda.

### Supplies
- Baking Soda
- Vinegar
- Empty Water Bottles
- Balloons
- Measuring Spoons
- Small Funnel

### 1. Ask a Question
If mixing vinegar and baking soda initiates a chemical reaction that produces carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) and water (H<sub>2</sub>O), **does more baking soda create more CO<sub>2</sub>**?

### 2. Hypothesize

Once you have a question you can answer with an experiment (for example, what happens when I mix baking soda and vinegar?), you should create a hypothesis - that is a prediction of what you *think* will happen. 

### 3. Experiment

Now it is time to experiment. Follow the steps below to run at least three experiements, changing the amounts baking soda and vinegar you mix in each one - be sure to take good notes. 

1. Blow up the balloon a bit to stretch it out some.
2. Use the funnel and teaspoon to add baking soda to the balloon. Start with a small amount, like 2 teaspoons, and add more for each consecutive experiment.
3. Fill the empty water bottle *halfway* with vinegar.
4. Attach the balloon to the bottle, making sure you have a good seal!
5. Lift up the balloon to dump the baking soda into the bottle of vinegar
6. Watch what happens when the two substances mix - make notes of your observations.

### 4. Observe & Record

Observations are critical to science. Make sure during the experiments that you watch what is happening and take notes of your observations. 

Things to observe:
- How much vinegar did you use?
- How much Baking Soda did you use?
- What happened to the balloon?

### 5. Analyze

After you run the experiment at least 3 times, look over your notes and see if you can make a conclusion (that's a fancy way to say 'describe the science you observed').

### 6. Share Results

Share your hypothesis, experiments, observations and conclusion with your Nova Counselor.
