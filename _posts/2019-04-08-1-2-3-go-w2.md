# Overview
This module is designed to help you explore how mathematics affects your life each day. 
In Week 2 of the *1-2-3 Go!* Nova module you will conduct an opinion poll and chart the results, and conduct a probability experiment.

The following are the requirements addressed in Week 2.

1. Complete both of the following:
    - (a) Conduct an opinion survey through which you collect data to answer a question and then show your results with a chart or graph. For example what is the favorite food of the Scouts in your den (chart how many like pizza, how many like cookies, etc.).
    - (b). Conduct and keep a record of a coin toss probability experiment. Keep track of at least 25 tosses.

For the full requirements, see *[1-2-3 Go!](https://www.scouting.org/stem-nova-awards/awards/cub-scout/1-2-3-go/)* on Scouting.org.
