# Meet a Scientist
This week you will wrap up the *Science Everywhere* module with a visit to a place where science is done - a doctors office or clinic. This is a great place to learn how science is used in every day things.

## Where Do Scientists Work?
Scientists can be found in every day life all around you. Here are some examples of scientists that you may knwo or have met:

- **Doctors and nurses** are medical scientists.
- **Horticulturists and botanists** are scientists who study the lifecycle of plants and the science fo growing plants. They may work in greenhouses, or nurseries, or may even be landscapers.
- **Zoologists** are scientists who study animals. They often work at the zoo as animal care givers and zoo keepers.
- **Data Scientists** are scientists that perform experiments on data, mayube for artificial intelligence. Data Scientists typically work at technology companies like Amazon, Facebook, Google, and Microsoft or other companies working with data.


## Go Say 'Hi'
This week you will meet a scientist at their place of work. One of the easiest scientists to meet is a doctor or nurse, like your pediatrician. Doctors and nurse use science and the *scientific method* every day when they work with patients. 

1. **Ask a question** - Doctors and nurses start by asking you questions - "Where does it hurt?" or "When did you start feeling ill?"
2. **Hypothesize** - After learning about your symptoms, doctors and nurses create a hypothesis based on what they already know, or from research they do about your symptoms.
3. **Experiment** - Doctors and nurse do experiments to treat your symptoms, like prescribing medicine, or changing what you eat. Fortunately doctors and nurses know a lot about common injuries and illnesses, so they pick experiments that they are pretty sure will be successful.
4. **Observe & record** - While you are following the doctor's or nurse's directions (experiment), they ask you to record what happens - like does the pain go away, does the redness go away.
5. **Analyze** - The doctors and nurse analyze the results from their experiment to determine if it was successful or not, and whether or not more experiments need to be done.
6. **Share results** - Doctors and nurses explain the results to you if needed. If your injury or illness was somewhat unique, and the doctor or nurse discovered something new (like a new treatment) then they share their results in medical papers that other doctors and nurses read. In the papers, they presenting your symptoms and their hypothesis, experiment, observations, and conclusions.
