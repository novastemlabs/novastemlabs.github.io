# Overview
Physics is the area of science that focuses on stuff know as *matter* and *energy*. This week you will use the scientific method to conduct a series of physical experiments. 

The following are the requirements addressed in Week 3.

3. Act like a scientist! Explore EACH of the following:
  - With your counselor, choose a question you would like to investigate.
  - With your counselor or adult partner, use the scientific method/process to investigate your question. Keep records of your question, the information you found, how you investigated, and what you found out about your question (you may do this with another Cub Scout if you would like, but you need to do and record your own work).
  - Discuss your investigation and findings with your counselor.

For the full requirements, see *[Science Everywhere](https://www.scouting.org/stem-nova-awards/awards/cub-scout/science-everywhere/)* on Scouting.org. 

# Will it Sink or Float?
Not everything floats. Of course, not everything sinks either. How do you know what will sink and what will float?

### Supplies

- (1) large conatainer, such as a clear vase or jar, filled with water.
- Salt (a couple of cups, depending on the size of the container).
- (2) Halos or Little Cutie oranges (one peeled, one unpeeled).
- (1) Egg.
- Any other objects that you want to test.

### 1. Ask a Question
Looking at the objects you have, you could ask something like **will all of these float?** and **what happens if there is salt in the water?**

### 2. Hypothesize
Once you have a question you can answer with an experiment, you should create a hypothesis - that is a prediction of what you *think* will happen (for example, predicting what will sink and what will float).

### 3. Experiment

Now it is time to experiment. Follow the steps below - be sure to take good notes. 

1. Fill the continer with water if it is not already filled.
2. One thing at a time, carefully drop it into the water and see what happens (observer & record).
    - Start with the unpeeled orange.
    - Next try the peeled orange.
    - Next try the egg.
3. After taking notes, remove the objects and add salt (enough to make the water turn a bit white).
4. Now try each item again - if it sank before, does it still sink? If it floated before, does it still float?
5. If nothing changed, add more salt and try step 4 again.

### 4. Observe & Record
Observations are critical to science. Make sure during the experiments that you watch what is happening and take notes of your observations. 

Things to observe:
- What was the object and did it sink or float?
- How much salt sis you add?
- Did anything change about the sinking or floating after you added salt??

### 5. Analyze
After you run the experiment, look over your notes and see if you can make a conclusion (that's a fancy way to say 'describe the science you observed').

### 6. Share Results
Share your hypothesis, experiments, observations and conclusion with your Nova Counselor.

# Homework
Watch **[MythBusters Waterslide Wipeout](https://vimeo.com/20320049)**. 

In this episode, Adam and Jamie use the *scientific method* to prove (or disprove) their hypothesis about a giant water slide.

Alternatively, you can watch any videos/shows about science for about 30-minutes (or read for 30-minutes about science.)

This activity will address the remaining 50% of Requirement #1.
