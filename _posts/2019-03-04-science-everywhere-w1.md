# Overview
This module is designed to help you explore how science affects your life each day. 
In Week 1 of the *Science Everywhere* Nova module you will get introduced to the **scientific method**

The following are the requirements addressed in Week 1.

1. Watch an episode or episodes (about one hour total) of a show about anything related to science. Then do the following:

    * Make a list of at least two questions or ideas from what you watched.
    * Discuss two of the questions or ideas with your counselor.

For the full requirements, see *[Science Everywhere](https://www.scouting.org/stem-nova-awards/awards/cub-scout/science-everywhere/)* on Scouting.org. 

# Homework
Watch **The Magic School Bus Rides Again - Season 1, Episode 8 - Three in One**. 

This episode focuses on the three (3) states of H<sub>2</sub>O - ice, water and steam. This
is a great intro to how substances can change simply by changing something that affect them - in this case, the temperature.
